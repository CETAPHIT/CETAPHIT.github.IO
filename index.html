<p><strong>Preface</strong>：</p>
<p>This dictionary has been&nbsp;created for those&nbsp;who&nbsp;need&nbsp;&nbsp;up-to-date&nbsp;definitions of&nbsp;words that describe females and those&nbsp;interested in learning English words referring to&nbsp;females.This dictionary is intended to help&nbsp;international students learn about&nbsp;American culture and the different ways to describe&nbsp;women or girls. I am a international student, and&nbsp;students like me&nbsp;may be not familiar with the usage and interpretation of English words. So, I defined&nbsp;these&nbsp;English words by watching TV talk shows and TV dramas. I think these words related to&nbsp;females may helpful&nbsp;to the reader. For those who&nbsp;already know the meaning of the words, this dictionary&nbsp;is a great chance to look back, and also the reader&nbsp;may find a novel &nbsp;meaning.&nbsp;This dictionary&nbsp;presents&nbsp;the definition, pronuanciation&nbsp;and some examples of the word. I would also put some pictures in this&nbsp;dictionary to add some fun.</p>
